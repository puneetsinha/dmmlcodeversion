================================
Students: 2024ab05134, 2024aa05664

Model Building is the process of developing a machine learning (ML) or statistical model 
that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions.

It involves preparing the data, choosing the right algorithm, training the model, 
evaluating its performance, and tuning it for accuracy.

TRAINING PROCESS OVERVIEW
=========================

1. DATA PREPARATION
   - Loaded and preprocessed telco customer churn dataset
   - Performed feature engineering and scaling
   - Split data into training and testing sets (80/20)
   - Applied feature selection techniques

2. ALGORITHM SELECTION
   - Logistic Regression: Baseline linear model
   - Random Forest: Ensemble method for complex patterns
   - XGBoost: Gradient boosting for high performance
   - Gradient Boosting: Alternative boosting approach

3. MODEL TRAINING
   - Implemented hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
   - Cross-validation with 5 folds
   - Training time monitoring and optimization
   - MLflow integration for experiment tracking

4. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - ROC-AUC and Precision-Recall AUC
   - Confusion matrix analysis
   - Learning curves and validation curves

5. MODEL TUNING
   - Hyperparameter optimization
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Model selection based on business metrics
   - Final model validation
