**Students: 2024ab05134, 2024aa05664**  
**Target Repository**: [https://github.com/puneetsinha/BitsPilaniAIML](https://github.com/puneetsinha/BitsPilaniAIML)

## Ready to Push!

I've prepared everything needed to push your complete DMML project to your existing GitHub repository. Your project will be added alongside your other BITS Pilani AIML files.

## What's Ready

**Complete ML Pipeline Project** - All 10 components implemented  
**Professional Documentation** - README, guides, and reports  
**Git Setup Scripts** - Automated push to your repository  
**Project README** - Comprehensive documentation for GitHub  
**Version Control** - Tagged releases and commit history  

## Simple 3-Step Process

### Step 1: Install Git
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
Wait for installation to complete, then verify:
```bash
git --version
```

### Step 2: Run Automated Push
```bash
cd /Users/puneetsinha/DMML
python directory_8_data_versioning/push_to_github.py
```

### Step 3: Verify on GitHub
Visit [https://github.com/puneetsinha/BitsPilaniAIML](https://github.com/puneetsinha/BitsPilaniAIML) to see your uploaded project!

## What Will Be Uploaded

Your GitHub repository will contain:
