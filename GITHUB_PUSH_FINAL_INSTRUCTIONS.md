# GitHub Push - Final Instructions

## Current Status
Your DMML project is **completely ready** for GitHub! Everything has been set up:

- Git repository initialized
- 999 files committed locally
- Remote repository configured: `https://github.com/puneetsinha/BitsPilaniAIML`
- Comprehensive commit message with project details

## Authentication Required

The only remaining step is GitHub authentication. GitHub no longer accepts password authentication.

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. **Generate Token:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a name: "DMML Project Push"
   - Select scopes: `repo` and `workflow`
   - Set expiration (30 days recommended)
   - Click "Generate token"

2. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

3. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/puneetsinha/DMML
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   - Username: `puneetsinha`
   - Password: `[paste your token here]`

### Option 2: SSH Authentication

If you have SSH keys set up:
```bash
cd /Users/puneetsinha/DMML
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:puneetsinha/BitsPilaniAIML.git
git push -u origin main
```

## What Will Be Pushed

**Total Files:** 999
**Project Components:**
- Complete ML pipeline (10 stages)
- MLflow experiment tracking
- Trained models (4 algorithms)
- Data lake with processed datasets
- Comprehensive documentation
- Feature store implementation
- Data validation reports
- Pipeline orchestration logs

## After Successful Push

Once pushed, your repository will contain:
- Complete end-to-end ML pipeline
- Student IDs: 2024ab05134, 2024aa05664
- Course: Data Management for Machine Learning
- All assignment deliverables
- Production-ready code architecture

## Important Notes

1. **Token Security:** Never share your Personal Access Token
2. **One-time Setup:** Once authenticated, future pushes will be easier
3. **Repository:** https://github.com/puneetsinha/BitsPilaniAIML
4. **Backup:** Your project is safely committed locally

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure token has correct permissions (`repo` scope)
2. Double-check repository exists: https://github.com/puneetsinha/BitsPilaniAIML
3. Verify username is exactly: `puneetsinha`
