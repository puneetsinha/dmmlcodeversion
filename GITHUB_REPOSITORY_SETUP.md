# SOLUTION: Create GitHub Repository First

## The Issue
The repository `BitsPilaniAIML` doesn't exist on GitHub yet. That's why we're getting the 403 permission error.

## Quick Solution (2 minutes):

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to: **https://github.com/new**
2. Repository name: **BitsPilaniAIML**
3. Description: **Complete End-to-End ML Pipeline for Customer Churn Prediction - DMML Assignment**
4. Make it **Public**
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have our files)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Tell Me It's Done!
Once you've created the repository, just say "done" or "created" and I'll immediately push all 999 files!

## What Will Happen Next
Once the repository exists, I'll run:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

And your complete DMML project will be live on GitHub with:
- 999 files
- Complete ML pipeline
- All trained models
- MLflow experiments
- Comprehensive documentation
- Student IDs and assignment details

##  Repository URL (after creation):
https://github.com/puneetsinha/BitsPilaniAIML

---
**Status:** Waiting for repository creation
**Next:** Push 999 files to GitHub!
