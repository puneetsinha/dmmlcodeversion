DEFINITION: ORCHESTRATE
=======================

The word "Orchestrate" in data science / ML / cloud computing contexts means:

Coordinating and automating multiple tasks, processes, or services so they work
together smoothly as one system.

It's like being a conductor of an orchestra — ensuring each instrument (data pipeline,
model training, deployment, monitoring) plays at the right time in harmony.

PIPELINE ORCHESTRATION OVERVIEW
================================

Our implementation uses Apache Airflow to orchestrate the complete end-to-end 
machine learning pipeline for customer churn prediction. The orchestration 
coordinates 8 distinct pipeline components in a carefully designed sequence.

ORCHESTRATED PIPELINE COMPONENTS
=================================

1. DATA INGESTION
   - Function: data_ingestion()
   - Purpose: Collect data from multiple sources (Kaggle, HuggingFace)
   - Dependencies: None (starting point)
   - Execution Time: ~2 seconds

2. RAW DATA STORAGE
   - Function: raw_data_storage()
   - Purpose: Store raw data in partitioned data lake
   - Dependencies: Data Ingestion
   - Execution Time: ~1 second

3. DATA VALIDATION
   - Function: data_validation()
   - Purpose: Quality checks and consistency validation
   - Dependencies: Raw Data Storage
   - Execution Time: ~1 second

4. DATA PREPARATION
   - Function: data_preparation()
   - Purpose: Data cleaning and preprocessing

6. FEATURE STORE
   - Function: feature_store()
   - Purpose: Centralized feature management
   - Dependencies: Data Transformation

7. DATA VERSIONING
   - Function: data_versioning()
   - Purpose: Version control for data and models
   - Dependencies: Feature Store
   - Execution Time: ~1 second

8. MODEL BUILDING
   - Function: model_building()
   - Purpose: Train and evaluate ML models
   - Dependencies: Data Versioning
   - Execution Time: ~4 seconds
