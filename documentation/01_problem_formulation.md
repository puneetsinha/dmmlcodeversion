# Problem Formulation: Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline

## Business Problem Definition

**Customer churn** occurs when existing customers stop using a company's services or purchasing its products, effectively ending their relationship with the company. This project focuses on **addressable churn** - scenarios where proactive intervention could prevent customer loss.

### Problem Statement
As a Data Engineer for a predictive analytics startup, we need to build a robust automated pipeline to process customer data from multiple sources for a machine learning model that predicts customer churn. The goal is to identify at-risk customers before they churn, enabling the business to take proactive retention actions.

### Business Impact
- **Revenue Protection**: PWC research indicates financial institutions will lose 24% of revenue in 3-5 years due to churn to fintech companies
- **Cost Efficiency**: Retaining existing customers is 5-25x cheaper than acquiring new ones
- **Competitive Advantage**: Preventing customers from switching to competitors
- **Customer Lifetime Value**: Maximizing long-term customer relationships

## Key Business Objectives

1. **Predict Customer Churn**: Develop a model with >85% accuracy in identifying customers likely to churn within the next 30-90 days
2. **Early Warning System**: Provide actionable insights 30+ days before potential churn
3. **Automated Pipeline**: Create a fully automated, scalable data pipeline that processes data in near real-time
4. **Cost Reduction**: Reduce customer acquisition costs by improving retention rates by 15%
5. **Revenue Growth**: Increase customer lifetime value by 20% through proactive retention

## Data Sources and Attributes

### Primary Data Sources

#### 1. Transactional Database (Internal)
- **Source**: Company's CRM/billing system
- **Frequency**: Real-time/hourly updates
- **Key Attributes**:
  - Customer ID, account information
  - Monthly charges, total charges, payment history
  - Service usage patterns, contract details
  - Support ticket history, interaction logs

#### 2. Web Analytics API (Third-party)
- **Source**: Google Analytics / Adobe Analytics API
- **Frequency**: Daily batch processing
- **Key Attributes**:
  - Website engagement metrics (page views, session duration)
  - Feature usage patterns
  - Login frequency and recency
  - User journey and conversion funnels

#### 3. External Customer Data (Kaggle/Hugging Face)
- **Source**: Public datasets for training/validation
- **Frequency**: One-time ingestion for model development
- **Key Attributes**:
  - Demographics (age, gender, location)
  - Service subscriptions and preferences
  - Historical churn labels for supervised learning

### Data Volume and Characteristics
- **Expected Volume**: 100K+ customer records, 1M+ transactions monthly
- **Data Types**: Structured (80%), semi-structured (15%), unstructured (5%)
- **Historical Data**: 24+ months for trend analysis
- **Real-time Requirements**: New customer events processed within 15 minutes

## Expected Pipeline Outputs

### 1. Clean Datasets for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Format**: Parquet files, CSV exports
- **Content**: Deduplicated, validated customer data
- **Quality Metrics**: Data completeness >95%, accuracy >98%
- **Deliverable**: Clean datasets with quality reports

### 2. Transformed Features for Machine Learning
- **Feature Engineering**: 50+ engineered features including:
  - Customer tenure and lifecycle stage
  - Usage trend indicators (increasing/decreasing)
  - Payment behavior patterns
  - Support interaction frequency
  - Product adoption scores
- **Format**: Feature store with metadata
- **Versioning**: Tracked changes with DVC

### 3. Deployable Model for Customer Churn Prediction
- **Model Type**: Ensemble of Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression
- **Output Format**: Serialized model (pickle/joblib), containerized API
- **Prediction Interface**: REST API returning churn probability and risk factors
- **Deployment**: Docker container ready for production

### 4. Automated Monitoring and Alerting
- **Pipeline Health**: Data quality monitoring, model performance tracking
- **Business Alerts**: High-risk customer notifications
- **Operational Metrics**: Processing times, error rates, data freshness

## Measurable Evaluation Metrics

### Model Performance Metrics
- **Primary**: F1-Score ≥ 0.82 (balanced precision and recall)
- **Precision**: ≥ 0.80 (minimize false positives - avoid unnecessary retention costs)
- **Recall**: ≥ 0.85 (minimize false negatives - catch actual churners)
- **AUC-ROC**: ≥ 0.88 (overall discriminative ability)
- **Business Metric**: Prevent 25% of predicted churns through intervention

### Pipeline Performance Metrics
- **Data Freshness**: <4 hours lag from source to model input
- **Pipeline Reliability**: 99.5% uptime, <2% failed runs
- **Processing Time**: Complete pipeline execution in <2 hours
- **Data Quality**: >95% data completeness, <1% validation failures

### Business Impact Metrics
- **Churn Rate Reduction**: Target 15% reduction in monthly churn
- **ROI**: 300% return on investment within 12 months
- **Customer Lifetime Value**: 20% increase for intervention-targeted customers
- **Cost Savings**: $500K annually in reduced acquisition costs

## Success Criteria

1. **Technical Success**: Pipeline processes 100K+ records daily with <2% error rate
2. **Model Accuracy**: Consistently achieves target metrics in production
3. **Business Impact**: Measurable reduction in churn rate within 6 months
4. **Operational Efficiency**: Automated pipeline requires <5 hours/week maintenance
5. **Scalability**: System handles 3x current data volume without performance degradation

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Data Quality Issues**: Implement comprehensive validation and monitoring
- **Model Drift**: Continuous monitoring and automated retraining
- **Pipeline Failures**: Robust error handling and alerting systems

### Business Risks
- **False Positives**: Balance precision/recall to minimize retention campaign costs
- **Privacy Concerns**: Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance in data handling
- **Change Management**: Provide clear ROI demonstration and training

This problem formulation provides the foundation for building a comprehensive, business-aligned customer churn prediction pipeline that delivers measurable value while maintaining operational excellence.
