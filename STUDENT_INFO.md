- Advanced feature engineering techniques
- Machine learning model comparision and evaluation
- Production-ready pipeline development
- Data quality assesment and validation

## Individual Contributions
Both team members contributed equally to all aspects of the project, focusing on different components while maintaining collaborative oversight of the entire pipeline.

## Technical Challenges Faced
1. **Data Integration**: Handling different data formats and sources required careful consideration
2. **Feature Engineering**: Balancing feature complexity with model performance was challenging
3. **Pipeline Orchestration**: Implementing robust error handling and retry logic took significant effort
4. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring efficient memory usage across all pipeline steps

## Key Insights Learned
